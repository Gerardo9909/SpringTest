For this project I used elasticsearch v7.6.2 image in docker
Set the IP of the elasticsearch container (docker inspect <container-id>) in elasticsearch-url variable located in application.properties
Build and run the Dockerfile
You can use postman to test the endpoint: http://localhost:8080/user (GET, POST, PUT)
